## Binary Search
You are given an integer array 'A' of size 'N', sorted in ascending order. You are also given an integer 'target'.
Your task is to write a function to search for 'target' in the array 'A'. If it exists, return its index in 0-based indexing. Otherwise, return -1.
Note: You must write an algorithm whose time complexity is O(logN).

## Bubble Sort
Provided with a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N, you must sort this array using 'Bubble Sort'.
Note:
Change in the input array/list itself. You don't need to return or print the elements.

## Insertion Sort
Provided with a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N, you have been required to sort this array using 'Insertion Sort'.

## Merge Two Sorted Arrays
You have been given two sorted arrays/lists(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M respectively, merge them into a third array/list such that the third array is also sorted.

## Push Zeros to end
You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N. You have been required to push all the zeros that are present in the array/list to the end of it. Also, make sure to maintain the relative order of the non-zero elements.

## Rotate array
You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N. Write a function that rotates the given array/list by D elements(towards the left).
Sample Input 1:
```
1
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
2
```
Sample Output 1:
```
3 4 5 6 7 1 2
```

## Second Largest in array
You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N. You are required to find and return the second largest element present in the array/list.
If N <= 1 or all the elements are same in the array/list then return -2147483648 or -2 ^ 31(It is the smallest value for the range of Integer)

Sample Input 3:
```
2
2
6 6
4
90 8 90 5
```
Sample Output 3:
```
-2147483648
8
```
