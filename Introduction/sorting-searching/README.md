## Binary Search
You are given an integer array 'A' of size 'N', sorted in ascending order. You are also given an integer 'target'.
Your task is to write a function to search for 'target' in the array 'A'. If it exists, return its index in 0-based indexing. Otherwise, return -1.
Note: You must write an algorithm whose time complexity is O(logN).

## Bubble Sort
Provided with a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N, you must sort this array using 'Bubble Sort'.
Note:
Change in the input array/list itself. You don't need to return or print the elements.
