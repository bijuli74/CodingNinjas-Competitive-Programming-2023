## Check Palindrome
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters.
Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequences of characters which read the same backwards and forwards.

## Trim Spaces
Given an input string S that contains multiple words, you need to remove all the spaces present in the input string.
There can be multiple spaces present after any word.

## Reverse Word Wise
Reverse the given string word wise. That is, the last word in given string should come at 1st place, last second word at 2nd place and so on. Individual words should remain as it is.

## Print All Substrings
For a given input string(str), write a function to print all the possible substrings.
Substring
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. 
Example: "cod" is a substring of "coding". Whereas, "cdng" is not as the characters taken are not contiguous

## Column Wise Sum
Given a 2D integer array of size M*N, find and print the sum of ith column elements separated by space.
Input Format :
First and only line of input contains M and N, followed by M * N space separated integers representing the elements in the 2D array.
Output Format :
Sum of every ith column elements (separated by space)

## Largest Row or Column
For a given two-dimensional integer array/list of size (N x M), you need to find out which row or column has the largest sum(sum of all the elements in a row/column) amongst all the rows and columns.
Note :
If there are more than one rows/columns with maximum sum, consider the row/column that comes first. And if ith row and jth column has the same largest sum, consider the ith row as answer.

## Wave Print
For a given two-dimensional integer array/list of size (N x M), print the array/list in a sine wave order, i.e, print the first column top to bottom, next column bottom to top and so on.
Sample Input 1:
```
1
3 4 
1  2  3  4 
5  6  7  8 
9 10 11 12
```
Sample Output 1:
```
1 5 9 10 6 2 3 7 11 12 8 4
```

## Spiral Print
For a given two-dimensional integer array/list of size (N x M), print it in a spiral form. That is, you need to print in the order followed for every iteration:
a. First row(left to right)
b. Last column(top to bottom)
c. Last row(right to left)
d. First column(bottom to top)
 Mind that every element will be printed only once.
Sample Input 1:
```
1
4 4 
1 2 3 4 
5 6 7 8 
9 10 11 12 
13 14 15 16
```
Sample Output 1:
```
1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5 6 7 11 10 
```
 
## Check Permutation
For a given two strings, 'str1' and 'str2', check whether they are a permutation of each other or not.
Permutations of each other
Two strings are said to be a permutation of each other when either of the string's characters can be rearranged so that it becomes identical to the other one.

Example: 
str1= "sinrtg" 
str2 = "string"

The character of the first string(str1) can be rearranged to form str2 and hence we can say that the given strings are a permutation of each other.

## Remove Consecutive Duplicates
For a given string(str), remove all the consecutive duplicate characters.
Example:
Input String: "aaaa"
Expected Output: "a"

Input String: "aabbbcc"
Expected Output: "abc"
 Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces. All the characters in the string would be in lower case.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints the updated string.

## Reverse Each Word
Aadil has been provided with a sentence in the form of a string as a function parameter. The task is to implement a function so as to print the sentence such that each word in the sentence is reversed.
Example:
Input Sentence: "Hello, I am Aadil!"
The expected output will print, ",olleH I ma !lidaA".

## Remove character
For a given a string(str) and a character X, write a function to remove all the occurrences of X from the given string.
The input string will remain unchanged if the given character(X) doesn't exist in the input string.

## Highest Occuring Character
For a given a string(str), find and return the highest occurring character.
Example:
Input String: "abcdeapapqarr"
Expected Output: 'a'
Since 'a' has appeared four times in the string which happens to be the highest frequency character, the answer would be 'a'.

## Compress the String
Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.
Example:
If a string has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this "xxxxx" with "x5".

The string is compressed only when the repeated character count is more than 1.
Sample Input 2:
```
aaabbcddeeeee
aaabbccdsa
```
Sample Output 2:
```
a3b2cd2e5
a3b2c2dsa
```
