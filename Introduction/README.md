## Total Salary
Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.

## Sum of even & odd
Write a program to input an integer N and print the sum of all its even digits and sum of all its odd digits separately.
Digits mean numbers, not the places! That is, if the given integer is "13245", even digits are 2 & 4 and odd digits are 1, 3 & 5.

## Find power of a number
Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1

Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)
Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)

## Nth Fibonacci Number
Nth term of Fibonacci series F(n), where F(n) is a function, is calculated using the following formula -
    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), 
    Where, F(1) =  1, 
           F(2) = 1
Provided N you have to find out the Nth Fibonacci Number.
Input Format :
The first line of each test case contains a real number ‘N’.
Output Format :
For each test case, print its equivalent Fibonacci number.

## All Prime Numbers
Given an integer N, print all the prime numbers that lie in the range 2 to N (both inclusive).
Print the prime numbers in different lines.

### Count Characters
Write a program to count and print the total number of characters (lowercase english alphabets only), digits (0 to 9) and white spaces (single space, tab i.e. '\t' and newline i.e. '\n') entered till '$'.
That is, input will be a stream of characters and you need to consider all the characters which are entered till '$'.
Print count of characters, count of digits and count of white spaces respectively (separated by space).
Input Format :
A stream of characters terminated by '$'
Output Format :
3 integers i.e. count_of_characters count_of_digits count_of_whitespaces (separated by space)
Sample Input :
abc def4 5$
Sample Output :
6 2 2
