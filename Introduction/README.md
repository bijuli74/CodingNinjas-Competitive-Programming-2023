## Total Salary
Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.

## Sum of even & odd
Write a program to input an integer N and print the sum of all its even digits and sum of all its odd digits separately.
Digits mean numbers, not the places! That is, if the given integer is "13245", even digits are 2 & 4 and odd digits are 1, 3 & 5.

## Find power of a number
Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1

Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)
Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)
