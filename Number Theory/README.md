## Find Prime Numbers
You are given a positive integer ‘N’. Your task is to print all prime numbers less than or equal to N.
Note: A prime number is a natural number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Example - 2, 3, 17, etc.
You can assume that the value of N will always be greater than 1. So, the answer will always exist.

## Segmented Sieve Problem
In this problem you have to print all primes from given interval.

## Super Prime $
A number is called super-prime if it has exactly two distinct prime divisors
Example 10 , 6
You are supposed to find the count of super-prime numbers between 1 and N (inclusive).

## Ninja and Flowers $
Ninja wants to get N flowers and he will pay i + 1 amount of money for the Ith flower, example (if n=3 he will pay {2,3,4})
Now he wants to pack these N flowers in boxes of different colours. With one condition if the cost of a flower is a prime divisor of another flower they needed to be of a different colour.
As we know that ninja is a little money minded he wants to minimize the number of different colours of boxes that he needs.

## Special Prime
Special Prime is a prime number that can be written as the sum of two neighbouring primes and 1.
You are given an integer N and you are supposed to find the number special prime in the range: [1, N].
Example of special prime 19 = 7 + 11 + 1
Neighbouring primes are prime number such that there is no other prime number between them.

## Number Of Factors $
A number is called n-factorful if it has exactly n distinct prime factors. Given positive integers a, b, and n, your task is to find the number of integers between a and b, inclusive, that are n-factorful. We consider 1 to be 0-factorful.

## Sachin and Varun Problem
Varun and you are talking about a movie that you have recently watched while Sachin is busy teaching Number Theory. Sadly, Sachin caught Varun talking to you and asked him to answer his question in order to save himself from punishment. The question says:
Given two weights of a and b units, in how many different ways you can achieve a weight of d units using only the given weights? Any of the given weights can be used any number of times (including 0 number of times).
Since Varun is not able to answer the question, he asked you to help him otherwise he will get punished.
Note: Two ways are considered different if either the number of times a is used or a number of times b is used is different in the two ways.

## Totient function
You are given an integer N and are supposed to find the value of Euler toient function for N phi(N)

## GCD Sum
Consider all numbers from 1 to ‘N’, your task is to find the sum of gcd of all pairs (i, j) such that 1 <= i < j <= N.
For example for N = 3, all pairs are { (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3) }.
Note :
Gcd of two numbers (X, Y) is defined as the largest integer that divides both ‘X’ and ‘Y’. 

## Divisors of Factorial
Given a number, find the total number of divisors of the factorial of the number.
Since the answer can be very large, print answer modulo 10^9+7.

## Strange order
Given an integer n . Initially you have permutation p of size n : p[i] = i . To build new array a from p following steps are done while permutation p is not empty:
Choose maximum existing element in p and define it as x ; Choose all such y in p that gcd ( x , y ) ≠ 1 ; Add all chosen numbers into array a in decreasing order and remove them from permutation. Your task is to find a after p became empty.
Note: gcd ( a , b ) is the greatest common divisor of integers a and b .

## Card Game $
Vova again tries to play some computer card game.
The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number ai is written on the i-th card in the deck.
After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.
Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?

## Find The Cube Free Number
A cube free number is a number who’s none of the divisor is a cube number (A cube number is a cube of a integer like 8 (2 * 2 * 2) , 27 (3 * 3 * 3) ). So cube free numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 etc (we will consider 1 as cube free). 8, 16, 24, 27, 32 etc are not cube free number. So the position of 1 among the cube free numbers is 1, position of 2 is 2, 3 is 3 and position of 10 is 9. Given a positive number you have to say if its a cube free number and if yes then tell its position among cube free numbers.
Note: we will consider 1 as the 1st cube free number

## Euler Totient Function Sum
You are given a positive integer ‘N’, your task is to return an array/list of integers such that the sum of Euler Totient Function values of each integer of the array is equal to ‘N’.
Euler Totient Function:
In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer ‘N’ that is relatively prime to ‘N’.

## Find the good sets! $
You are given array a consisting of n distinct integers. A set s of numbers is called good if you can rearrange the elements in such a way that each element divides the next element in the order, i.e. 'si' divides 'si + 1', such that i < |s|, where |s| denotes size of set |s|.
Find out number of distinct good sets that you can create using the values of the array. You can use one value only once in a particular set; ie. a set cannot have duplicate values. Two sets are said to be different from each other if there exists an element in one set, which does not exist in the other.
As the answer could be large, print your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
