## Find Prime Numbers
You are given a positive integer ‘N’. Your task is to print all prime numbers less than or equal to N.
Note: A prime number is a natural number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Example - 2, 3, 17, etc.
You can assume that the value of N will always be greater than 1. So, the answer will always exist.

## Segmented Sieve Problem
In this problem you have to print all primes from given interval.

## Super Prime $
A number is called super-prime if it has exactly two distinct prime divisors
Example 10 , 6
You are supposed to find the count of super-prime numbers between 1 and N (inclusive).

## Ninja and Flowers $
Ninja wants to get N flowers and he will pay i + 1 amount of money for the Ith flower, example (if n=3 he will pay {2,3,4})
Now he wants to pack these N flowers in boxes of different colours. With one condition if the cost of a flower is a prime divisor of another flower they needed to be of a different colour.
As we know that ninja is a little money minded he wants to minimize the number of different colours of boxes that he needs.

## Special Prime
Special Prime is a prime number that can be written as the sum of two neighbouring primes and 1.
You are given an integer N and you are supposed to find the number special prime in the range: [1, N].
Example of special prime 19 = 7 + 11 + 1
Neighbouring primes are prime number such that there is no other prime number between them.

## Number Of Factors $
A number is called n-factorful if it has exactly n distinct prime factors. Given positive integers a, b, and n, your task is to find the number of integers between a and b, inclusive, that are n-factorful. We consider 1 to be 0-factorful.
