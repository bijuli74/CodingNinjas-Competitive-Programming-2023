## Odd Frequency
You are given an array of size N with all elements with even frequency except one and you are supposed to find this element.

## Element that Appears Once
You are given an arbitrary array ‘arr’ consisting of N non-negative integers, where every element appears thrice except one. You need to find the element that appears only once.

## Find The Repeating And Missing Number
You are given an array 'nums' consisting of first N positive integers. But from the N integers, one of the integers occurs twice in the array, and one of the integers is missing. You need to determine the repeating and the missing integer.

## Unset ith Bit
You are given two integers N and i. You need to make ith bit of binary representation of N to 0 and return the updated N.
Counting of bits start from 0 from right to left.

## Clear All Bits From MSB
You are given two integers N and i. You need to clear all bits from MSB to ith bit (start i from right to left) and return the updated N.
Counting of bits starts from 0 from right to left.

## XOR of Natural Numbers
You are given an integer N and asked to find the Xor of first N natural numbers.

## Pairwise Sum of Hamming Distance
You are given an array ARR having N integers. Your task is to find the sum of Hamming Distance for each pair of the array elements.
Hamming Distance for two given integers 'A' and 'B' is defined as the minimum number of bits that needs to be toggled to make both the integers equal.
For example:
Consider A=4 and B=7
Binary representation of 4 = 100
Binary representation of 7 = 111
For the given example, if we flip the values of the last two least significant bits of A to 1 then A will become 7. As we can change the value of A to B by 2 flips. Therefore the Hamming Distance, in this case, is 

## Xor Sum $
You are given two arrays, ‘arr1’ of size 'N' and ‘arr2’ of size 'M'. You need to create an array of bitwise AND of all the possible pairs between the elements of both arrays, and your task is to find the XOR sum of the array. The XOR sum of an array is equal to the XOR of all elements of the array.
Note:
The XOR sum of [A, B, C] is equal to A XOR B XOR C.

## Ninja and the task
Given an integer 'X' your task is to count the number of integer values 'Y' such that ('X' ^ 'Y') > 'X' and 0 < 'Y' < 'X'.
Where ( ^ ) is the bitwise xor operator.
EXAMPLE:
Input: 'X' = 2
Output: 1

There is only one value of 'Y' = 1 satisfies the condition ('X' ^ 'Y') > 'X' and 0 < 'Y' < 'X'

## Find First Set Bit
You are given an integer N. You need to return an integer M, in which only one bit is set which at the position of a lowest set bit of N (from right to left).
